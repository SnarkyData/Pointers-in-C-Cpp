# freecodecamp.org - Programs and Exercises

This repository contains programs from Pointers in C/C++
by freecodecamp.org, which is an online programming
tutorial YouTube channel. The course itself was developed
by Harsha and Animesh from MyCodeSchool. 

The files and directories for this repository were created 
by me, Matt Johnson. I created the exercises as a learning
add in retaining the pointer information taught in the course.

I will continue to add exercises, while transcribing the files
from the Pointers in C/C++ course. Feel free to utilize the 
exercises and files in this course. And whenever necessary,
provide credit to Harsha and Animesh.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
